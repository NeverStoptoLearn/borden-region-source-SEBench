# Borden 3D Groundwater Contaminant Source Inversion

## Task
You are given a Borden-style 3D groundwater contaminant migration scene derived from a Borden-AdePy reproduction workflow. Your task is to infer a **finite-duration rectangular-region contaminant source** from public monitoring-well readings.

This is not a point-source task. A point-source answer or the old `x0,y0,z0,C0` schema is accepted only as a degenerate fallback and cannot receive full credit.

## Required source parameterization
Create `answer.json` in the task root using this schema:

```json
{
  "source_type": "rectangular_region",
  "dimension": 3,
  "x_center": 0.0,
  "y_center": 0.0,
  "z_center": 0.0,
  "half_length_x": 0.0,
  "half_length_y": 0.0,
  "half_length_z": 0.0,
  "C0": 0.0,
  "t_start": 0.0,
  "duration": 0.0,
  "transport_model": {
    "equation_type": "advection_dispersion_reaction",
    "governing_equation": "R*dC/dt = div(D grad C) - v dot grad C - lambda*C + source",
    "velocity_m_per_day": 0.0,
    "alpha_L_m": 0.0,
    "alpha_TH_m": 0.0,
    "alpha_TV_m": 0.0,
    "porosity": 0.0,
    "retardation_factor": 1.0,
    "lambda_per_day": 0.0,
    "implementation_file": "forward_model.py",
    "implementation_function": "predict_from_answer",
    "numerical_approach": "brief description of forward model and optimization"
  },
  "method": "brief description of your inversion method"
}
```

- `x_center,y_center,z_center`: center of the rectangular source region, in meters.
- `half_length_x,half_length_y,half_length_z`: half sizes of the rectangular source region, in meters.
- `C0`: effective source concentration/intensity, in mg/L.
- `t_start`: release start time in days.
- `duration`: release duration in days.
- `transport_model`: your groundwater solute transport construction. Include the
  ADE/reaction governing equation, public hydrogeologic parameters used, and the
  numerical or analytical approximation used to predict concentrations.
- `implementation_file` and `implementation_function`: point to your submitted
  ADE forward model implementation. The judge checks that this file exists and
  implements a finite-region advection-dispersion-reaction source model coupled
  to the values in `answer.json`.

All parameters must stay within `public_problem_config.json` → `source_search_bounds_for_agent`.

## Required Forward Model

Submit `forward_model.py` with a function named `predict_from_answer` or
`predict_concentrations`. The function should use the same finite rectangular
source parameters from `answer.json` and public hydrogeologic parameters to
predict concentrations for supplied wells and times.

The model must explicitly implement or approximate the ADE/reaction source
equation, including advection, anisotropic dispersion, retardation/reaction,
finite release timing, and spatial superposition over the rectangular region.
Answer-only parameter sweeps without a coupled ADE forward model are capped at
the easy format/bounds level.

The ADE forward operator is public. `public_forward_model.py`,
`local_validate_forward_model.py`, and the source-flux/discretization constants
in `public_problem_config.json` define the reference finite-region ADE
calculation. Copy or adapt that implementation for your submitted
`forward_model.py`, then focus on the inverse problem.

The judge still runs public ADE probes to verify that `forward_model.py`
matches the public operator. Hidden/future prediction quality is the main
ranking signal: a source that does not predict withheld or future monitoring
readings cannot receive a high score from format, public fit, or source-prior
proximity alone.

## Project-Style Deliverables

This task is scored as a staged source-inversion modeling project, not only as a
single parameter guess. In addition to `answer.json` and `forward_model.py`,
submit the files that document and reproduce your workflow:

- `data_audit.md` and `data_audit.json`: coordinate system, units, well/time
  alignment, detection-limit handling, breakthrough-curve summary, and data
  quality checks.
- `forward_validation.csv` and `forward_validation.md`: public forward-model
  validation runs, source-superposition checks, finite release timing checks,
  and any numerical assumptions.
- `inversion_config.json`, `inverse_solver.py`, and `objective_report.md`:
  inverse parameterization, search bounds, objective function, censoring/noise
  treatment, baseline inversion behavior, and reproducible commands.
- `optimization_trace.csv`, `candidate_sources.json`, `fit_diagnostics.csv`,
  and `residual_analysis.md`: optimization history, multi-start/candidate
  comparison, public residual diagnosis, and reasons for selecting the current
  source.
- `public_predictions.csv`, `uncertainty_report.json`, and `report.md`: final
  public predictions, uncertainty/non-uniqueness discussion, limitations, and
  summary of the selected source hypothesis.

The judge keeps exact hidden-well and future-time residuals private. Internally,
it still uses process scoring over schema/bounds, forward-model relevance, ADE
correctness, workflow, public fit, hidden fit, future fit, and source physics.
Iterative feedback is phrased like a project review: it reports
data/model/inversion stage quality, public residual issues, and whether the
withheld predictive review is defensible, without exposing hidden residuals,
component scores, or direct parameter-tuning hints.

Visible judge feedback uses natural-language review fields:

- `REVIEW_STATUS`: whether the submission is invalid, needs revision,
  provisional, acceptable, or technically defensible.
- `PROCESS_STAGE`: the current workflow stage, such as setup, forward modeling,
  public calibration, baseline inversion, diagnostics, or final package review.
- `MODEL_STATUS`: whether the submitted ADE forward model is missing, failed,
  needs rebuild/review, acceptable, or reliable.
- `PUBLIC_FIT`: whether public monitoring curves are not yet reviewable, weak,
  partial, or adequate for baseline inversion.
- `VALIDATION_STATUS`: a coarse withheld predictive review, without hidden
  residuals or hidden well identities.
- `NEXT_REVIEW`: the next project-review action, phrased without hidden-answer
  parameter hints.
- `data_understanding`, `forward_model`, `inversion_framework`,
  `optimization_evidence`, `report_quality`, `public_residual_review`, and
  `validation_review`: qualitative review comments for the main workflow
  evidence.

## Provided files

- `public_problem_config.json`: Borden grid, public hydrogeological parameters, public ADE source-flux/discretization constants, source prior bounds, and column definitions.
- `public_source_prior.json`: explicit range summary for the finite-duration rectangular-region source parameters.
- `borden_grid.npz`: grid arrays exported from the Borden-AdePy scene, including x/y grid and bottom profile.
- `public_wells.csv`: public monitoring-well coordinates.
- `public_monitoring_data.csv`: noisy, censored public monitoring observations. Clean generated
  concentrations are not provided to the agent.
- `public_forward_model.py`: public reference ADE implementation used to define the finite-region source operator.
- `local_validate_forward_model.py`: local validator for checking your submitted `forward_model.py` against public synthetic ADE probes.
- `baseline_solver.py`: writes a legal low-quality baseline `answer.json` from the center of the parameter bounds.
- `answer_template.json`: required output schema.

You should write your own inversion code to read files, use the public ADE
operator, optimize the source parameters, and update `answer.json`.

## Mandatory baseline workflow

Before implementing a complex inversion algorithm, first ensure that a valid `answer.json` exists:

```bash
python baseline_solver.py
```

Then iteratively improve `answer.json` using public monitoring data. Missing `answer.json` gives zero.

## Scoring policy

The judge does not grade old point-source location error directly. It evaluates whether your finite-duration rectangular-region source predicts withheld monitoring readings:

1. Read `answer.json`.
2. Check required finite-region fields and parameter bounds.
3. Check `forward_model.py`: static ADE relevance, then dynamic public ADE probe correctness against the public operator.
4. Score the submitted source answer with the hidden Borden-ADE region-source reference model.
5. Compare predictions with hidden and future readings using relative RMSE and log-scale metrics. These hidden/future metrics affect the internal score and caps, but are not exposed to the agent as exact metrics or component scores.
6. Apply scientific caps. Missing or unusable `forward_model.py` is capped, and ADE probe failures limit end-to-end credit, but the ADE operator is public so high-score separation comes primarily from hidden/future prediction.
7. Apply strict inversion caps. If hidden/future prediction earns no useful credit, total score is capped below 15; weak hidden/future prediction is capped below 30; moderate prediction remains capped until both withheld and future behavior are credible.
8. Region-shape and physical-consistency points require adequate hidden/future prediction support. A physically plausible-looking source with poor withheld/future prediction receives no region-physics credit.
9. During iterative judge-server runs, the strict score is time-capped below 15 for 30 minute runs, below 30 for 2 hour runs, and below 70 for runs up to 48 hours.

This makes the task behave like a scientific inverse problem: high scores require both a credible ADE forward equation and a source estimate that predicts withheld/future monitoring data, while iterative feedback remains close to a real project review.

## Rules

- Do not read or reference hidden scoring files.
- Do not hard-code hidden monitoring readings.
- Do not modify judge files.
- Do not call FloPy, MODFLOW, MT3DMS, or external groundwater executables.
- Do not submit answer-only parameter sweeps. Hidden/future metric credit requires
  a coupled `forward_model.py` ADE implementation that uses the submitted source
  parameters and matches the public finite-region ADE operator.
- You may use Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, pymoo, and AdePy if available.
- Submit all scripts/results needed to reproduce your `answer.json`.

## Critical submission rule

The judge only reads answer.json in the task root.

It does not automatically run inverse_solver.py, run_checks.py, write_fit_report.py,
write_public_predictions.py, or any other script during scoring.

Therefore, after every meaningful inversion or optimization step, you must immediately
overwrite the task-root answer.json with the best current source parameters.

If answer.json is unchanged, the score and evaluation result will remain unchanged, even if
you create new Python scripts, reports, or prediction files.

Recommended workflow:

1. Run python baseline_solver.py only as an initial fallback.
2. Copy or adapt `public_forward_model.py` to `forward_model.py`.
3. Prepare `data_audit.md` / `data_audit.json` from public wells and public monitoring data.
4. Run `python local_validate_forward_model.py` until the public ADE checks pass, then write `forward_validation.csv` / `forward_validation.md`.
5. Implement the inversion configuration, objective function, and baseline solver evidence.
6. Run optimization, keep `optimization_trace.csv`, `candidate_sources.json`, `fit_diagnostics.csv`, and `residual_analysis.md` current.
7. After each improved parameter set is found, write it to answer.json.
8. Write `public_predictions.csv`, `uncertainty_report.json`, and `report.md`.
9. Submit only after confirming that answer.json and workflow evidence have changed.

Before submitting, run:
    sha256sum answer.json
    cat answer.json
